BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 12.20 15.72 <F0_M> what i 'm going to show you first as quickly as i can is
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 15.72 24.25 <F0_M> is some some foundational work some some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago this is seadragon
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 24.25 40.62 <F0_M> and it 's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of of visual data we 're looking at many many gigabytes of of digital photos here and kind of seam seamlessly and continuously zooming in panning through the thing rearranging it in any way we want and
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 40.62 54.60 <F0_M> it doesn 't matter how much information we 're looking at how big these collections are or how big the images are in the most of them are ordinary digital camera photos but this one for example is a scan from the library of congress and it 's in the in the three hundred megapixel range
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 54.60 62.85 <F0_M> it doesn 't doesn't make any difference because the only thing that that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 62.85 74.52 <F0_M> it 's also very flexible architecture this is an entire book this is an example of non non image data this is bleak house by dickens every every column is a is a chapter
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 74.52 83.35 <F0_M> and to prove to you that it 's that it 's really text and not an image we can do something like so to really show that this is a real representation of the text it 's not a picture
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 83.35 98.47 <F0_M> maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e book i wouldn 't recommend it this is a more realistic case this is an issue of the guardian every large image is the beginning of a section and this really gives you the the the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 98.47 108.86 <F0_M> of a magazine or a newspaper which is an inherently multi scale kind of medium we 've also done a little something with the corner of of this particular issue of the guardian we 've made up a fake ad
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 108.86 121.34 <F0_M> that 's very high resolution much higher than you 'd be able to get in an ordinary ad and we 've embedded extra content if you want to see the features of this car you can see it here or other models or even technical specifications
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 121.34 134.12 <F0_M> and and this this really this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with with those limits on on screen real estate we hope that this means no more no more pop ups and other kind of rubbish like that shouldn 't be necessary
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 134.12 142.99 <F0_M> of course mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this and and this one i really won 't spend any time on except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well

BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 144.29 148.40 <F0_M> but those are all the roads in the in the u s superimposed on top of a nasa
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S44 148.40 149.84 <F0_M> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 149.84 171.41 <F0_M> geospatial image so let 's pull up now something else so this is actually live on the live on the web now you can go check it out this is a project called photosynth which really marries two different technologies one of them is seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by noah snavely a graduate student at the university of washington co advised by steve seitz at u w and rick szeliski at microsoft research
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 171.41 182.72 <F0_M> a very nice collaboration and so this is this live on the web it 's powered by seadragon you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views where we can we can we can dive through images and have this kind of multi resolution experience
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 182.72 196.97 <F0_M> but but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these these shots all taken near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 197.03 206.23 <F0_M> all these shots were taken so you see elements here of of stabilized slide show or panoramic panoramic imaging
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 206.23 220.84 <F0_M> and these things have all been related related spatially i 'm not sure if i have if i have time to show you any other environments there are some that are much more spatial but i would like to jump straight to to one of noah 's original data sets and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 220.84 233.57 <F0_M> to show you what i think is really the the punchline behind this this technology the photosynth technology and it 's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we 've put up on the website we we had to worry about the lawyers and so on
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 233.63 241.09 <F0_M> this is a reconstruction of notre dame cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from flickr you just type notre dame into flickr
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 241.09 251.95 <F0_M> and you get some pictures of guys in t shirts and of the campus and so on and each of these orange cones represents an image that was that was discovered to belong to this model
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S44 251.95 253.30 <F0_M> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 253.30 259.99 <F0_M> and so these are all these are all flickr images and they 've all been related spatially in this way and we can just navigate in this very simple way
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S44 259.99 270.83 <F0_M> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 270.83 276.92 <F0_M> you know i never i never thought that i 'd end up working at microsoft it 's very it 's very gratifying to to have this kind this kind of reception here
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S44 276.92 280.63 <F0_M> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 280.63 294.57 <F0_M> so so this is i guess you can see this is very this is lots of different types of cameras it 's everything from cell phone cameras to professional slrs quite a large number of them stitched together in this environment and if i can i 'll find some of the sort of weird ones
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 294.57 298.56 <F0_M> so many of them are occluded by faces and and so on
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S44 298.56 299.61 <F0_M> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 299.61 312.56 <F0_M> there 's somewhere in here there is actually there there is series of photographs here we go this is actually a poster of notre dame that registered correctly here we can dive in from the poster to a physical view
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 312.56 314.56 <F0_M> of this of this environment
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S44 314.56 318.57 <F0_M> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 318.57 329.96 <F0_M> what what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment this is this is now taking data from everybody from the entire collective memory of of visually what the earth looks like 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 329.96 341.75 <F0_M> and link all of that together all of those photos become linked together and they make something emergent that 's greater than the sum of the parts you have a a model that emerges of the entire earth think of this as the long tail to stephen lawler 's
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 341.75 353.53 <F0_M> virtual earth work and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it and whose benefits become greater to the users as they as they use it their own photos are getting tagged with meta data that somebody else entered
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 353.53 359.82 <F0_M> if if somebody bothered to to tag all of these saints and say who they all are then then my photo of
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 359.82 370.08 <F0_M> notre dame cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data and i can use it as an entry point to dive into that space into that meta verse using everybody else 's photos and and do a kind of a cross modal
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 370.08 380.65 <F0_M> and and and cross user social experience that way and of course a by product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of of every interesting part of the earth
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 380.71 388.67 <F0_M> collected not just from from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on but from the collective memory thank you so much
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S44 388.67 400.16 <F0_M> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S62 400.16 408.12 <F0_M> do i do i understand this do i understand this right that what what your software is going to allow is that at some point really within the next few years
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S62 408.12 409.89 <F0_M> all the pictures
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S62 409.96 414.19 <F0_M> that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 414.20 419.24 <F0_M> yes what this is really doing is discovering it 's creating hyperlinks if you will between between images
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 419.24 428.68 <F0_M> and it 's doing that based on the content inside the images and that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have like when you do a web search for images 
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 428.68 442.22 <F0_M> you type in phrases and the text on the web page is is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of now what if that picture links to all of your pictures then the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge it 's a classic network effect
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 S62 442.22 444.42 <F0_M> blaise that is truly incredible congratulations
BlaiseAguerayArcas_2007 1 Blaise_Agueray_Arcas 444.42 444.89 <F0_M> thanks so much
