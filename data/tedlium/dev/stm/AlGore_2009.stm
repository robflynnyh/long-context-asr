AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 13.04 23.46 <F0_M> last year i showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower forty eight states has shrunk by forty percent
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 23.46 40.05 <F0_M> but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn 't show the thickness of the ice the arctic ice cap is in a sense the beating heart of the global climate system it expands in winter and contracts in summer the next slide i show you will be
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 40.05 52.68 <F0_M> a rapid fast forward of what 's happened over the last twenty five years the permanent ice is marked in red and as you see it expands to the dark blue that 's the annual ice in winter and it contracts in summer
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 52.68 60.29 <F0_M> and the so called permanent ice five years old or older you can see is almost like blood spilling out of the body here
AlGore_2009 1 S28 60.29 62.60 <F0_M> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 62.60 69.05 <F0_M> in twenty five years it 's gone from this to this this is a problem because the warming
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 69.05 86.33 <F0_M> heats up the frozen ground around the arctic ocean where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which when it thaws is turned into methane by microbes compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere that amount could double if we cross this tipping point
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 86.33 97.90 <F0_M> already in some shallow lakes in alaska methane is actively bubbling up out of the water professor katey walter from the university of alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter

AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 110.68 118.30 <F0_M> she 's okay the question is whether we will be and one reason is this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 118.30 126.59 <F0_M> this is an annual melting river but the volumes are much larger than ever this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 126.59 135.11 <F0_M> greenland if you want to know how sea level rises from land base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea these flows are increasing very rapidly
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 135.11 145.34 <F0_M> at the other end of the planet antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance and west antarctica
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 145.34 154.09 <F0_M> cropped up on top some under sea islands is particularly rapid in its melting that 's equal to twenty feet of sea level as is greenland
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 154.09 168.56 <F0_M> in the himalayas the third largest mass of ice at the top you see new lakes which a few years ago were glaciers forty percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow in the andes this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 168.56 186.78 <F0_M> the flows have increased but when they go away so does much of the drinking water in california there has been a forty percent decline in the sierra snowpack this is hitting the reservoirs and the predictions as you 've read are serious this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 186.78 205.16 <F0_M> and the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate four times as many in the last thirty years as in the previous seventy five this is a completely unsustainable pattern if you look at in the context of history you can see
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 205.16 209.55 <F0_M> what this is doing
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 209.55 217.91 <F0_M> in the last five years we 've added seventy million tons of co two every twenty four hours twenty five million tons every day to the oceans
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 217.91 229.16 <F0_M> look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific from the americas extending westward and on either side of the indian subcontinent where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 229.16 236.68 <F0_M> the biggest single cause of global warming along with deforestation which is twenty percent of it is the burning of fossil fuels oil is a problem
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 236.68 254.15 <F0_M> and coal is the most serious problem the united states is one of the two largest emitters along with china and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants but we 're beginning to see a sea change here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 254.15 270.30 <F0_M> however there is a political battle in our country and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal which is an oxymoron that image reminded me of something

AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 273.70 289.49 <F0_M> around christmas in my home in tennessee a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled you probably saw it on the news this all over the country is the second largest waste stream in america this happened around christmas one of the coal industry 's ads around christmas was this one

AlGore_2009 1 S13 313.04 319.79 <F0_M> let me be clear about it al gore nancy pelosi harry reid they don 't know what they 're talking about 
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 319.79 326.07 <F0_M> so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns this is one of them part of one of them
AlGore_2009 1 S45 326.07 338.81 <F0_M> coalergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business that 's why we 've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal
AlGore_2009 1 S45 338.81 342.42 <F0_M> the fact is coal isn 't dirty we think it 's clean

AlGore_2009 1 S45 345.38 350.03 <F0_M> so don 't worry about climate change leave that up to us

AlGore_2009 1 S50 351.76 356.80 <F0_M> clean coal you 've heard a lot about it so let 's take a tour of this state of the art clean coal facility

AlGore_2009 1 S50 359.77 365.37 <F0_M> amazing the machinery is kind of loud but that 's the sound of clean coal technology

AlGore_2009 1 S50 366.43 374.01 <F0_M> and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything 
AlGore_2009 1 S50 374.01 379.09 <F0_M> take a good long look this is today 's clean coal technology
AlGore_2009 1 Al_Gore 379.09 385.34 <F0_M> finally the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge
AlGore_2009 1 S54 385.34 390.66 <F0_M> america is in crisis the economy national security the climate crisis
AlGore_2009 1 S54 390.66 396.15 <F0_M> the thread that links them all our addiction to carbon based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil
AlGore_2009 1 S54 396.15 400.79 <F0_M> but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess repower america
AlGore_2009 1 S54 400.79 409.21 <F0_M> with one hundred percent clean electricity within ten years a plan to put america back to work make us more secure and help stop global warming 
AlGore_2009 1 S54 409.21 414.90 <F0_M> finally a solution that 's big enough to solve our problems repower america find out more
