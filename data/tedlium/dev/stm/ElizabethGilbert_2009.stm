ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 12.80 27.15 <F0_F> i am a writer writing books is my profession but it 's more than that of course it is also my great lifelong love and fascination and i don 't expect that that 's ever going to change but that said
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 27.15 37.16 <F0_F> something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 37.22 59.07 <F0_F> and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called eat pray love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere i go now people treat me like i 'm doomed
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 59.08 79.14 <F0_F> seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now all worried and they say aren 't you afraid aren 't you afraid you 're never going to be able to top that aren 't you afraid you 're going to keep writing for your whole life and you 're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 79.14 94.42 <F0_F> so that 's reassuring you know but it would be worse except for that i i happen to remember that over twenty years ago when i first started telling people when i was a teenager that i wanted to be a writer i was met with this same kind of sort of fear based reaction and people would say
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 94.42 111.18 <F0_F> aren 't you afraid you 're never going to have any success aren 't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren 't you afraid that you 're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing 's ever going to come of it and you 're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 S183 111.18 112.33 <F0_F> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 112.33 115.64 <F0_F> like that you know and a a the answer
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 115.65 128.00 <F0_F> the short answer to all those questions is yes yes i 'm afraid of all those things and i always have been and i 'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can 't even guess at like
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 128.00 148.14 <F0_F> seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing the the thing that i 've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do you know and what is it
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 148.14 161.55 <F0_F> specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other 's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don 't do you know like my dad for example was a chemical engineer
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 161.55 177.28 <F0_F> and i don 't recall once in his forty years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn 't come that chemical engineering block john you know how 's it going it just didn 't come up like that you know but
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 176.87 187.00 <F0_F> to be fair right chemical engineers as a group you know haven 't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives and
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 187.18 202.02 <F0_F> we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable and you know all you have to do is look at the very grim
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 202.02 214.46 <F0_F> death count in the twentieth century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know and even the ones who didn 't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 214.47 222.80 <F0_F> by their gifts you know norman mailer just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 223.00 231.43 <F0_F> an extraordinary statement to make about your life 's work you know but we don 't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we 've heard that kind of stuff
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 231.43 251.09 <F0_F> for so long and somehow we 've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 251.09 269.62 <F0_F> like are you comfortable with that because you look at it even from an inch away and you know i 'm not at all comfortable with that assumption i think it 's odious and i also think it 's dangerous and i don 't want to see it perpetuated into the next century i think it 's better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 269.62 287.49 <F0_F> you know and i and i i definitely know that in in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that i 'm in right now in my career which is you know
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 287.49 305.67 <F0_F> like check it out i 'm pretty young i 'm only about forty years old i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me and it 's exceedingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 305.67 312.30 <F0_F> i i should just put it bluntly because we 're all sort of friends here now it 's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 312.30 321.30 <F0_F> you know so jesus what a thought you know like that 's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o 'clock in the morning and
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 321.30 334.55 <F0_F> you know i don 't want to go there you know i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that i have to
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 334.55 347.62 <F0_F> work now in order to continue writing is that i have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right i have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as i am writing and my
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 347.62 362.73 <F0_F> very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is gonna be from now on and and as i 've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that i 've been sort of looking across time and i 've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 362.73 375.78 <F0_F> better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of of creativity and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 375.78 402.03 <F0_F> so stay with me cause it does circle around and back but ancient greece and ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then ok people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity daemons
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 402.03 413.14 <F0_F> socrates famously believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 413.14 418.41 <F0_F> which is great cause the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 418.41 427.32 <F0_F> individual they believed that a genius was this sort of magical divine entity who was believed to literally live in the walls
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 427.33 448.82 <F0_F> of an artist 's studio kind of like dobby the house elf and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there that distance that i 'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know and everyone knew that this is how it functioned
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 448.82 455.75 <F0_F> right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 455.75 468.16 <F0_F> you couldn 't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like this disembodied genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know everyone knew your genius was kind of lame and
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 468.16 473.04 <F0_F> this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 470.92 495.84 <F0_F> and then the renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let 's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and mysteries and there 's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and and it 's the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 495.84 504.75 <F0_F> you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and i got to tell you i think that was a huge
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 504.75 527.75 <F0_F> error you know i think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it 's like asking somebody to swallow the sun
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 527.75 536.06 <F0_F> you know it just completely warps and distorts egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance and i think the pressure of that
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 536.07 543.48 <F0_F> has been killing off our artists for the last five hundred years and if this is true and i i think it is true
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 543.48 556.33 <F0_F> the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 556.33 575.16 <F0_F> maybe not you know like maybe we can 't just erase five hundred years of rational humanistic thought in one eighteen minute speech and there 's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 575.16 593.32 <F0_F> rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like i i 'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this but the the question that i kind of want to pose is you know why not why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 593.32 602.74 <F0_F> in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 602.74 610.61 <F0_F> basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 610.61 629.15 <F0_F> paranormal i had this encounter recently where i met the extraordinary american poet ruth stone who 's now in her nineties but she 's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 629.15 646.31 <F0_F> from over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would shake the earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would run like hell to the house
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 646.31 669.04 <F0_F> and she would be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn 't be fast enough so she 'd be running and running and running and she wouldn 't get to the house and the poem would like barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 669.05 688.48 <F0_F> and and then there were these times this is the piece i never forgot she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it right so she 's like running to the house and she 's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it 's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 688.48 703.62 <F0_F> she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first

ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 705.22 712.78 <F0_F> so when i heard that i was like that 's you know that 's uncanny that 's exactly what my creative process is like
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 S183 712.78 716.04 <F0_F> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 716.04 731.14 <F0_F> it 's not at all my creative process i 'm not the pipeline you know like i 'm a mule and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like barrel through it really awkwardly but even i in my mulishness even i have brushed up against that thing
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 731.14 751.77 <F0_F> you know at times and i would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 751.77 767.96 <F0_F> that i have of how to do that is the musician tom waits who i got to interview several years ago on a on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know tom i mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 767.96 783.52 <F0_F> control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in los angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and and he 's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 783.52 797.79 <F0_F> this little fragment of melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes elusive and tantalizing and he wants it you know it 's gorgeous and and he longs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn 't have a piece of paper he doesn 't have a pencil he doesn 't have a tape recorder
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 797.79 811.76 <F0_F> so he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like i 'm going to lose this thing you know i 'm going to be haunted by this song forever and i 'm not good enough and i can 't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 811.76 818.47 <F0_F> completely novel he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that i 'm driving

ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 821.89 836.64 <F0_F> do i look like i can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when i can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother leonard cohen you know
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 836.64 841.42 <F0_F> and and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 841.43 853.16 <F0_F> oftentimes as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 853.16 865.95 <F0_F> and realized that this didn 't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange external thing that was not quite tom
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 865.95 884.99 <F0_F> so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when i was in the middle of writing eat pray love and i fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we 're working on something and it 's not coming and you start to think this is gonna be a disaster this is gonna be the worst book ever written
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 884.99 905.24 <F0_F> not just bad but the worst book ever written and and i started to think i should just dump this project you know but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i i i tried it so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and i i said aloud listen you thing
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 905.24 920.38 <F0_F> you and i both know that if this book isn 't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right cause you can see that i am putting everything i have into this you know i don 't have anymore than this so if you want it to be better then you 've got to show up and do your part of the deal ok but if you don 't do that
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 920.38 928.67 <F0_F> you know what the hell with it i 'm going to keep writing anyway because that 's my job and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 S183 928.67 932.56 <F0_F> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 932.56 943.19 <F0_F> because in the end it 's like this ok centuries ago in the deserts of north africa people used to gather for these
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 943.19 960.05 <F0_F> moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become transcendent
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 960.05 976.60 <F0_F> and i know you know what i 'm talking about because i know you 've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn 't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a thousand nights before but everything would align
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 976.60 995.26 <F0_F> and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by it 's name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 995.27 1002.40 <F0_F> allah allah allah god god god that 's god you know
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1002.41 1008.74 <F0_F> curious historical footnote when the moors invaded southern spain they took this
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1008.74 1027.56 <F0_F> custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from allah allah allah to ole ole ole which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances in spain when a performer has done something impossible and magic allah ole ole allah magnificent bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of god
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1027.56 1035.87 <F0_F> which is great because we need that but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1035.88 1050.46 <F0_F> when he wakes up and discovers that it 's tuesday at eleven a m and he 's no longer a glimpse of god he 's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he 's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1050.46 1060.99 <F0_F> chant god 's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1060.99 1082.80 <F0_F> you know but maybe it doesn 't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you 're finished with somebody else
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1082.80 1096.52 <F0_F> and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how i 've started to think and this is certainly how i 've been thinking in the last few months you know as i 've been working on the book that will soon be published as the
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1096.52 1112.40 <F0_F> dangerously frighteningly overanticipated follow up to my freakish success and and and what i have to sort of keep telling myself when i get really psyched out about that is don 't be afraid don 't be daunted just do your job
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1112.40 1125.72 <F0_F> continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1125.73 1132.91 <F0_F> for just one moment through your efforts then ole and if not do your dance anyhow
ElizabethGilbert_2009 1 Elizabeth_Gilbert 1132.91 1143.14 <F0_F> and ole to you nonetheless i believe this and i feel that we must teach it ole to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up
