JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 16.75 27.96 <o,f0,male> i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction in high school i i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 27.96 41.81 <o,f0,male> science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this in in a in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and and 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 41.81 45.72 <o,f0,male> you know that curiosity also manifested itself in in 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 45.72 51.55 <o,f0,male> the fact that whenever i wasn 't in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 51.55 62.48 <o,f0,male> samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was a real science geek but it was all about trying to understand 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 62.48 70.81 <o,f0,male> understand the world understand the the limits of of possibility and my you know love of of science fiction 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 70.81 77.18 <o,f0,male> actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this is in the late sixties 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 77.18 91.47 <o,f0,male> you know we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a you know a wondrous world that we could never really have 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 91.47 96.68 <o,f0,male> previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 96.68 111.29 <o,f0,male> and i was a an artist i could draw i could paint and and i i found that because there weren 't you know video games and this saturation of cg movies and and all of this imagery in the media landscape 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 111.29 123.57 <o,f0,male> i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the author 's description put something on on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 123.57 136.47 <o,f0,male> response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the behind the textbook and 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 136.47 145.15 <o,f0,male> that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened the the jacques cousteau 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 145.15 157.78 <o,f0,male> shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that that seemed pretty pretty darn unlikely 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 157.78 166.81 <o,f0,male> but i could that was a world i could really go to right here on earth that was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 166.81 178.03 <o,f0,male> so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 178.03 187.91 <o,f0,male> but i didn 't let that daunt me i pestered my father until he finally found a a scuba class in in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 187.91 194.37 <o,f0,male> and i actually got certified in a pool in a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 194.37 204.3 <o,f0,male> i didn 't see the ocean a a real ocean for another two years until we until we moved to california you know since then you know in in the in the intervening 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 204.3 214.81 <o,f0,male> forty years i 've i 've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and i 've learned that 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 214.81 222.29 <o,f0,male> that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with with amazing life 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 222.29 228.73 <o,f0,male> that really is beyond beyond our imagination you know nature 's imagination is so 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 228.73 240.14 <o,f0,male> so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 240.14 247.54 <o,f0,male> is ongoing and and just as strong as it ever was but when i when i chose a career as an adult 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 247.54 252.56 <o,f0,male> it was film making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 252.56 267.05 <o,f0,male> this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic books and so on so film making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 267.05 278.48 <o,f0,male> i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens and the abyss and with the abyss i i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with film making so you know 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 278.48 285.33 <o,f0,male> merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 285.33 293.82 <o,f0,male> that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 293.82 301.36 <o,f0,male> we actually embraced computer generated animation cg and  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 301.36 310.25 <o,f0,male> this this resulted in the first soft surface character cg animation that was ever in a in a movie 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 310.25 329.97 <o,f0,male> and even though the film didn 't make any money barely broke even i should say i witnessed something amazing which is that the the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic you know it 's arthur clarke 's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 329.97 343.78 <o,f0,male> and so that that that got me very excited and i thought wow this is this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with ilm we created the liquid metal 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 343.78 356.83 <o,f0,male> dude in that film the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we did make a little more money on that one so  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 356.83 367.61 <o,f0,male> you know drawing a line through those those two two dots of of experience came to this this is going to be a whole new world this was a whole new world of creativity for 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 367.61 377.93 <o,f0,male> for film artists so i i started a company with stan winston my good friend stan winston who is the the the premier make up and and creature designer 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 377.93 394.22 <o,f0,male> at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog past the kind of analog processes of of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 394.22 402.88 <o,f0,male> but we found ourselves lagging in the in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 402.88 409.61 <o,f0,male> so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 409.61 423.94 <o,f0,male> of visual effects of cg effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg and the main characters would all be in cg and the world would be in cg and  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 423.94 436.93 <o,f0,male> you know the envelope pushed back and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren 't going to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks 
JamesCameron_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 436.93 437.66 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 437.66 445.44 <o,f0,male> and you know i i went and pitched it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship it 's going to be this epic romance passionate 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 445.44 452.855 <o,f0,male> film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic and that 's why i made the movie 
JamesCameron_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 452.855 457.01 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 457.01 470.365 <o,f0,male> and that 's the truth now the studio didn 't know that but i convinced them i said i said we 're going to dive to the wreck we 're going to film it for real we 'll be using it in the opening of the film it will be really important it will be a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding an expedition 
JamesCameron_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 470.365 472.095 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 472.095 481.97 <o,f0,male> sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality because we actually created a reality where six months later i find myself in a russian submersible 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 481.97 489.515 <o,f0,male> two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through a view port not a movie not hd for real 
JamesCameron_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 489.515 492.51 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 492.51 501.36 <o,f0,male> now that that blew my mind and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 501.36 517 <o,f0,male> dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical and it required enormous planning you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can 't get back by yourself 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 517 522.97 <o,f0,male> and you know i i thought wow i 'm i 'm like living in a science fiction movie this is really cool 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 522.97 535.26 <o,f0,male> and so i i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration of course the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity it was imagination and it was an experience 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 535.26 546.87 <o,f0,male> that hollywood couldn 't give me because you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn 't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 546.87 562.91 <o,f0,male> i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and and sometimes things that i had had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them so i was completely smitten by this 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 562.91 577.81 <o,f0,male> and had to do more and so i actually made a kind of curious decision after the success of titanic i said okay you know i 'm going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker and i 'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 577.81 594.09 <o,f0,male> and so you know we started planning these these expeditions and we wound up going to the bismark and and exploring it with with robotic vehicles we went back to the titanic wreck we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 594.09 605.16 <o,f0,male> and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship which had never been done nobody had ever looked inside the wreck they didn 't have the means to do it so we created technology to do it 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 605.16 616.5 <o,f0,male> so you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submersible and looking out at planks that look much like this where i knew that the that the band had played 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 616.5 627.08 <o,f0,male> and i 'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the through the corridor of the of the ship you know when i say you know i 'm i 'm i 'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 627.08 636.44 <o,f0,male> i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i 've i 've ever had because 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 636.44 646.75 <o,f0,male> i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 646.75 656.02 <o,f0,male> and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship so it was this absolutely remarkable experience and it really made me realize that 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 656.02 663.46 <o,f0,male> made me realize that the the telepresense experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars then your consciousness 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 663.46 676.23 <o,f0,male> is is in injected into the into the vehicle into this this other form of existence it was really really quite profound and maybe a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening you know some decades out as 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 676.23 691.2 <o,f0,male> as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in in many sort of post human futures that i that i can imagine as a science fiction fan so having done these these 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 691.2 701.41 <o,f0,male> expeditions and and you know really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the deep ocean vents where we had these 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 701.41 709.87 <o,f0,male> amazing amazing animals they are basically aliens right here on earth they live in an environment of chemosynthesis they don 't survive  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 709.87 722.01 <o,f0,male> on sunlight based system the way we do and so you 're seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree centigrade water plumes that you think they can 't possibly exist at the same time 
JamesCameron_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 722.01 722.54 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 722.54 728.78 <o,f0,male> i was getting very interested in space science as well again you know it 's the science fiction influence as a kid 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 728.78 744.96 <o,f0,male> and i wound up getting involved with the space community really involved with with nasa sitting on the nasa advisory board planning actual space missions going to russia going to the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 744.96 755.94 <o,f0,male> to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three d camera systems and this was fascinating but what what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 755.94 764.95 <o,f0,male> and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists planetary scientists people who were interested in these extremely fine environments 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 764.95 775.85 <o,f0,male> taking them down to the vents and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space science  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 775.85 784.14 <o,f0,male> i 'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan you know as a kid and doing this stuff for real  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 784.14 794.53 <o,f0,male> and you know along the way in this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 794.53 803.36 <o,f0,male> leadership now you think directors got to be a leader leader of you know captain of the ship and all that sort of thing i didn 't really learn about leadership until 
JamesCameron_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 803.36 804 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 804 813.4 <o,f0,male> i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this what do i get out of it  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 813.4 828.31 <o,f0,male> we don 't make money at these damn shows you know we barely break even there is no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails someplace you know sitting at the beach made all these films made all these documentary films you know for a very 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 828.31 836.36 <o,f0,male> limited audience no fame no glory no money what are you doing you 're doing it for the task itself for the challenge  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 836.36 845.43 <o,f0,male> and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 845.43 853.73 <o,f0,male> when a small group of people form a tightly knit team because we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 853.73 861.99 <o,f0,male> sometimes at sea for for for two or three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 861.99 866.99 <o,f0,male> is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you that you 've done a task 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 866.99 880.26 <o,f0,male> that you can 't explain to someone else when you come back to the shore and you say you know we had to do this and the fiber optic and the attentuation and the this and the that all the all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 880.26 894.64 <o,f0,male> you can 't explain it to people it 's that thing that that maybe cops have or people in in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it creates a bond creates a bond of respect so when i came back to make my next movie which was avatar 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 894.64 906.87 <o,f0,male> i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return and it really changed the dynamic so here i was again with a small team  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 906.87 918.38 <o,f0,male> in you know in uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didn 't exist before tremendously exciting tremendously challenging and we became a family 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 918.38 935.33 <o,f0,male> over a four and half year period and it completely changed how i do movies so people have commented on how well you know you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself that changed as a result of that  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 935.33 949.08 <o,f0,male> so what can we synthesize out of all this you know what 's the what are the lessons learned well i think number one is curiosity it 's the most powerful thing you own imagination 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 949.08 962.11 <o,f0,male> is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world

JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 962.875 965.07 <o,f0,male> i have young film makers  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 965.07 968.945 <o,f0,male> come up to me and say you know give me some advice for doing this 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 968.945 970.74 <o,f0,male> and i say 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 970.74 984.28 <o,f0,male> don 't put limitations on yourself other people will do that for you don 't do it to yourself don 't bet against yourself and and take risks nasa has this has this phrase that they like failure is not an option 
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 984.28 994.54 <o,f0,male> but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration because it 's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 994.54 1005.1 <o,f0,male> was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so that 's the thought i would leave you with is that in whatever you 're doing failure  
JamesCameron_2010 1 JamesCameron 1005.1 1010.65 <o,f0,male> is an option but fear is not thank
