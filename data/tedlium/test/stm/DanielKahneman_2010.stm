DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 15.8 18.33 <o,f0,male> everybody talks about happiness these days 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 18.33 19.462 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 19.462 25.282 <o,f0,male> i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 25.282 29.75 <o,f0,male> and they gave up after about forty and there were many more 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 29.75 38.57 <o,f0,male> there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness coaching everybody would like to make people happier 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 38.57 40.068 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 40.068 48.52 <o,f0,male> but in spite of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 48.52 62.11 <o,f0,male> and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we 're just as messed up as anybody else is 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 62.11 63.424 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 63.424 76.34 <o,f0,male> the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 76.34 88.99 <o,f0,male> i think there is one particular meaning for to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we 'll have to give up and we 'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 88.99 104.99 <o,f0,male> the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it 's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they 're both lumped in the notion of happiness 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 104.99 119.79 <o,f0,male> and the third is it 's the focusing illusion and it 's the unfortunate fact that we can 't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance i mean this is a real cognitive trap there 's just no way of getting it right 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 119.79 121.27 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 121.27 126.79 <o,f0,male> now i 'd like to start with an example of somebody 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 126.79 130.64 <o,f0,male> who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 130.64 136.48 <o,f0,male> reported a story and that was the story he said he 'd been listening to the symphony 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 136.48 146.77 <o,f0,male> and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 146.77 149.82 <o,f0,male> it ruined the whole experience 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 149.82 152.51 <o,f0,male> but it hadn't 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 152.51 168.19 <o,f0,male> what it had ruined were the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 168.19 178.63 <o,f0,male> what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves there is an experiencing self 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 178.63 181.98 <o,f0,male> who lives in the present 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 181.98 196.32 <o,f0,male> and knows the present is capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it 's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor asks does it hurt now when i touch you here 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 196.32 198.93 <o,f0,male> and then there is a remembering self 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 198.93 202.82 <o,f0,male> and the remembering self is the one that keeps score 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 202.82 207.93 <o,f0,male> and maintains the story of our life and it 's the one that the doctor 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 207.93 210.56 <o,f0,male> approaches in asking the question 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 210.56 212.49 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 212.49 221.188 <o,f0,male> how have you been feeling lately or how was your trip to albania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 221.188 228.29 <o,f0,male> and the and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess of the notion of happiness 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 228.29 229.6 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 229.6 233.41 <o,f0,male> now the remembering self 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 233.41 237.8 <o,f0,male> is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 237.8 251.12 <o,f0,male> response of our memory it starts immediately we don 't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 251.12 254.982 <o,f0,male> and let me begin with one example 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 254.982 268.23 <o,f0,male> this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won 't go into detail it 's no longer painful these days but it was painful when this when this study was run in the nineteen nineties 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 268.23 277.008 <o,f0,male> they were asked to report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are asked 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 277.008 286.362 <o,f0,male> who of them suffered more and it 's a very easy question i mean clearly patient b suffered more his colonoscopy was longer and every 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 286.362 293.16 <o,f0,male> minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there is another question 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 293.16 296.31 <o,f0,male> how much did these patients think they suffered 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 296.31 296.98 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 296.98 298.59 <o,f0,male> and here is a surprise 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 298.59 309.156 <o,f0,male> and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than patient b the stories of the colonoscopies were different 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 309.156 315.11 <o,f0,male> and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 315.11 330.46 <o,f0,male> and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 330.46 344.486 <o,f0,male> it 's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for a than for b in memory 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 344.486 354.46 <o,f0,male> now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view of the experiencing self clearly b had a worse time 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 354.46 371.322 <o,f0,male> now what you could do with patient a and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much that will 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 371.322 384.78 <o,f0,male> cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 384.78 391.74 <o,f0,male> and you have the remembering self of patient a and lot better off because now you have endowed patient a 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 391.74 395.89 <o,f0,male> with a better story about his experience 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 395.89 396.856 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 396.856 399.58 <o,f0,male> what defines a story 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 399.58 417.69 <o,f0,male> and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it 's also true of the stories that we make up what defines a story are changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 417.69 419.146 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 419.146 423.39 <o,f0,male> now the experiencing self lives its life 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 423.39 433.1 <o,f0,male> continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 433.1 448.06 <o,f0,male> they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life and i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long which means that you know in in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 448.06 449.178 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 449.178 456.1 <o,f0,male> most of them don 't leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 456.1 460.088 <o,f0,male> and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 460.088 464.96 <o,f0,male> that what happens during these moments of experience is our life 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 464.96 469.734 <o,f0,male> it 's the finite resource that we 're spending while we 're on this earth 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 469.734 479.05 <o,f0,male> and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us so we have the 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 479.05 487.33 <o,f0,male> remembering self and the experiencing self and they 're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 487.33 488.596 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 488.596 497.412 <o,f0,male> from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 497.412 508.58 <o,f0,male> the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that 's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self a two week vacation is barely better 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 508.58 514.682 <o,f0,male> than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 514.682 528.33 <o,f0,male> and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self time has very little impact on this story 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 528.33 529.956 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 529.956 538.09 <o,f0,male> now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 538.09 547.894 <o,f0,male> because if you have a patient who has had say two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose then 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 547.894 555.75 <o,f0,male> the one that chooses is the one that has you know the memory that is less bad and that 's the the surgeon that will be chosen 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 555.75 568.97 <o,f0,male> the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don 't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 568.97 577.032 <o,f0,male> we don 't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 577.032 582.368 <o,f0,male> and basically you can look at this you know as a tyranny of the remembering self 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 582.368 590.588 <o,f0,male> and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn 't need 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 590.588 597.28 <o,f0,male> i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case that is that it 's 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 597.28 603.1 <o,f0,male> we we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 603.1 604.084 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 604.084 607.484 <o,f0,male> and this is a bit hard to justify i think i mean i 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 607.484 615.67 <o,f0,male> how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self and 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 615.67 624.83 <o,f0,male> when i think about that i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago which was clearly the best vacation i 've ever had and i think of it relatively often 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 624.83 628.832 <o,f0,male> relative to how much i think of other vacations and 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 628.832 644.2 <o,f0,male> i probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 644.2 648.47 <o,f0,male> now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 648.47 657.87 <o,f0,male> there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme you know in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of this 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 657.87 661.054 <o,f0,male> there is a genuine question 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 661.054 673.07 <o,f0,male> why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 673.07 681.02 <o,f0,male> imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 681.02 688.834 <o,f0,male> and you 'll get an amnesic drug so that you won 't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 688.834 694.13 <o,f0,male> and and if and if you would choose a different vacation 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 694.13 704.842 <o,f0,male> there is a conflict between your two selves and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict and it 's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 704.842 713.1 <o,f0,male> then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 713.1 721.07 <o,f0,male> why do we pick them the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two selves 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 721.07 731.678 <o,f0,male> now the two selves bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 731.678 740.77 <o,f0,male> and so you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self 's life 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 740.77 750.91 <o,f0,male> and they 're all happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 750.91 756.76 <o,f0,male> getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 756.76 758.594 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 758.594 773.612 <o,f0,male> if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it 's a completely different thing this is not about how happily a person lives it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 773.612 783.81 <o,f0,male> very different notions anyone who doesn 't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of well being 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 783.81 798.564 <o,f0,male> who 've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 798.564 811.5 <o,f0,male> and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallup organization has a world poll with more that half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 811.5 820.878 <o,f0,male> their experiences and there there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 820.878 826.68 <o,f0,male> and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 826.68 836.342 <o,f0,male> you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn 't teach you much about how happily they 're living their life 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 836.342 848.668 <o,f0,male> and vice versa you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is about point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told oh his father is six feet tall 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 848.668 858.95 <o,f0,male> would how much would you know about his height well you would know something about his height but there 's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 858.95 867.02 <o,f0,male> ranked their life eight on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 867.02 882.35 <o,f0,male> so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 882.35 885.6 <o,f0,male> being satisfied with people that we like 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 885.6 896.69 <o,f0,male> spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures but this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves you are going to end up doing very different things 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 896.69 907.68 <o,f0,male> the bottom line of what i 've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 907.68 908.998 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 908.998 917.16 <o,f0,male> now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 917.16 919.274 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 919.274 930.25 <o,f0,male> we do not attend the same to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 930.25 942.24 <o,f0,male> you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if if say you live in ohio 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 942.24 952.758 <o,f0,male> and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 952.758 965.882 <o,f0,male> and that contrast say is in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 965.882 970.57 <o,f0,male> but now because the reflective self is in charge 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 970.57 980.708 <o,f0,male> you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it 's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 980.708 985.588 <o,f0,male> well their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 985.588 987.14 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 987.14 990.396 <o,f0,male> but one thing will happen they will think they are happier 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 990.396 998.222 <o,f0,male> because when they think about it they 'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 998.222 1006.27 <o,f0,male> and they will feel they made the right decision it is very difficult to think straight about well being and 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1006.27 1010.99 <o,f0,male> i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you

DanielKahneman_2010 1 S164 1024.85 1030.49 <o,f0,male> you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 S164 1030.49 1034.21 <o,f0,male> is that is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now sure 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1034.21 1046.44 <o,f0,male> sure i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self

DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1048.06 1054.19 <o,f0,male> when you know we looked at how at how feelings vary with income 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1054.19 1068.44 <o,f0,male> and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that 's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it 's a large representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 S164 1068.44 1069.39 <o,f0,male> six sixty thousand
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1069.39 1070.48 <o,f0,male> sixty thousand

DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1072.72 1086.16 <o,f0,male> sixty thousand sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get above that we get an absolutely flat line i mean i 've rarely seen lines so flat 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1086.16 1094.48 <o,f0,male> clearly what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys you misery 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1094.48 1099.37 <o,f0,male> and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1099.37 1108.1 <o,f0,male> the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you earn the more satisfied you are that does not hold for emotions 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 S164 1108.1 1113.9 <o,f0,male> but danny the the whole american endeavor is about you know life liberty the pursuit of happiness

DanielKahneman_2010 1 S164 1115.01 1122.74 <o,f0,male> if people took seriously that finding i mean it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 S164 1122.74 1132.73 <o,f0,male> you know for example taxation policy and so forth is is there any chance that politicians that the country generally would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1132.73 1146.82 <o,f0,male> you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the uk it is happening and in other countries it is happening 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1146.82 1152.96 <o,f0,male> people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy of happiness when they think of public policy

DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1153.68 1167.55 <o,f0,male> it 's going to take a while and it 's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life evaluation so we need to have that debate fairly soon how to enhance happiness 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1167.55 1180.16 <o,f0,male> goes very different ways depending on how you think and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self this is going to influence policy i think in years to come in the united states efforts are being made 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 DanielKahneman 1180.16 1188.29 <o,f0,male> to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next decade or two part of national statistics 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 S164 1188.29 1192.25 <o,f0,male> well it seems to me this issue will or at least should be 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 S164 1192.25 1198.31 <o,f0,male> the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics 
DanielKahneman_2010 1 S164 1198.31 1199.44 <o,f0,male> thank you danny kahneman
