EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 18.434 31.66 <o,f0,male> for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in unless you think of it in the terms that i do which is something fake  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 31.66 45.67 <o,f0,male> is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real in other words sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies the placebo effect just because the person thinks  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 45.67 63.388 <o,f0,male> that what 's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a for pain management for example if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect something fake becomes something real because of someone 's perception of it  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 63.388 80.04 <o,f0,male> in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a rudimentary very simple magic trick and i 'm going to show you how it works this is a trick that 's been in every children 's magic book since at least the nineteen fifties i learned it myself from cub scout magic in the nineteen seventies  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 80.04 89.97 <o,f0,male> i 'll do it for you and then i 'll explain it and then i 'll explain why i explained it ok so here is what happens the knife which you can examine my hand which you could examine  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 89.97 99.49 <o,f0,male> i 'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this i 'll get my sleeve back and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i 'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here right  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 99.49 107.8 <o,f0,male> that way you can see that at no time can anything travel as long as i 'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve and the object of this is quite simple  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 107.8 108.7 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 108.7 113.88 <o,f0,male> i 'm going to open my hand and hopefully if all is well  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 113.88 114.08 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 114.08 121.096 <o,f0,male> my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife in fact it 's held so tightly in place that i can shake it  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 121.096 130.91 <o,f0,male> and the knife does not come off nothing goes up or down my sleeve no trickery and you can examine everything ta da  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 130.91 133.46 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 133.46 148.83 <o,f0,male> so this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very even though it 's a very simple trick methodologically probably many of you in the room know this trick what happens is this i hold the knife in my hand  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 148.83 159.968 <o,f0,male> i say i 'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve that is a lie the reason i 'm holding onto my wrist is because that 's actually the secret  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 159.968 170.09 <o,f0,male> of the illusion in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index finger is just going to shift from where it is to a position  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 170.09 172.67 <o,f0,male> pointing out like this  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 172.67 174.33 <o,f0,male> nice one  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 174.33 177.088 <o,f0,male> someone who didn 't have a childhood is out there  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 177.088 178.766 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 178.766 200.01 <o,f0,male> so it goes like this from here right and as i move around my finger shifts so we could talk about why this is deceptive why you don 't notice there are only three fingers down here because the mind and the way it processes information it doesn 't count one two three it groups them but that 's not really what this is about right and then i open my hand up obviously it 's clinging there not by animal magnetism but by  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 200.01 207.75 <o,f0,male> chicanery my index finger being there and then when i close my finger same thing as i move back  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 207.75 216.68 <o,f0,male> this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger i take this hand away you give the knife out there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors thanks now  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 216.68 217.44 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 217.44 220.69 <o,f0,male> what does that have to do with the placebo effect well  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 220.69 222.862 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 222.862 231.19 <o,f0,male> i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open i 'm not a doctor or a researcher so this to me was an astonishing thing  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 231.19 252.28 <o,f0,male> turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill that 's like aspirin shaped it 's just a round white pill it has some certain measurable effect but if you change the form that you give the placebo in like you make a smaller pill and color it blue and stamp a letter into it it is actually measurably more effective  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 252.28 261.54 <o,f0,male> even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical they 're sugar pills but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill what  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 261.54 262.02 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 262.02 269.15 <o,f0,male> that really flipped me out turns out though that that 's not even where it stops if you have capsules  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 269.15 283.522 <o,f0,male> they are more effective than tablets in any form a colored capsule that 's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule dosage has something to do with this you know one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 283.522 286.77 <o,f0,male> i don 't remember the statistic now sorry but the point is  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 286.77 288.836 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 288.836 296.17 <o,f0,male> these dosages have something to do with it and the form has something and if you want the ultimate in placebo you 've go to the needle  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 296.17 313.16 <o,f0,male> right a syringe with some inert a couple ccs of some inert something and you inject this into a patient well this is such a powerful image in their mind it it 's so much stronger than the white pill it 's a really this graph well i 'll show it to you some other time when we have slides the point is  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 313.16 314.63 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 314.63 326.76 <o,f0,male> the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality it 's only your belief that makes it real  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 326.76 340.506 <o,f0,male> in your body and makes a stronger effect i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 340.506 343.69 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 343.69 355.048 <o,f0,male> and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle this is a seven inch hat pin it 's very very sharp  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 355.048 360.61 <o,f0,male> and i 'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit ok  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 360.61 374.89 <o,f0,male> this is really my flesh this is not damian 's special grown flesh that 's my skin right there this is not a hollywood special effect i 'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 374.89 394.666 <o,f0,male> if you 're queasy if you if you faint easily i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night and some people that i didn 't know and one woman almost passed out so i suggest if you if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next thirty in fact you know what i 'll do the first bad part behind it you 'll get to see you can look away too if you 'd like to  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 394.666 402.75 <o,f0,male> so here is what happens right here the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 402.75 412.08 <o,f0,male> i 'm sorry man am i freaking you out ok and then just through my skin a tiny bit and out the other side like this  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 412.08 413.972 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 413.972 417.59 <o,f0,male> now essentially we 're in the same position we were in with the knife trick  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 417.59 422.538 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 422.538 423.966 <o,f0,male> sort of  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 423.966 432.678 <o,f0,male> but you can 't count my fingers right now can you so let me show them to you that 's one two three four five yes  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 432.678 435.145 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 435.145 442.66 <o,f0,male> i know what people think when they see this they go well he 's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 442.66 443.296 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 443.296 445.21 <o,f0,male> so let me give you a little peek  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 445.21 446.13 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 446.13 448.156 <o,f0,male> how 's that look out there pretty good  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 448.156 450.434 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 450.434 451.256 <o,f0,male> yeah i know  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 451.256 453.034 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 453.034 464.436 <o,f0,male> and the people in the back go okay i didn 't really see that people in the satellite room are like starting to move in now let me give you good close look at this that really is my skin that is not a hollywood special effect that 's my flesh  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 464.436 470.4 <o,f0,male> and i can twist that around i 'm sorry if you 're getting queasy look away don 't look at the thing  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 470.4 475.746 <o,f0,male> people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go well yeah that looks kind of neat in  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 475.746 481.814 <o,f0,male> some sort of effect there but if it were real he would be see there 's a hole there and a hole there if it were real he would be bleeding  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 481.814 483.74 <o,f0,male> let me work up some blood for you  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 483.74 488.312 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 488.312 490.978 <o,f0,male> yes there it is  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 490.978 512.16 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 512.16 520.77 <o,f0,male> normally now i would take the needle out i would clean off my arm and i would show you that there are no wounds but i think in this context and with the idea of  
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 520.77 527.5 <o,f0,male> taking something fake and making it into something real i 'm just going to leave it there and walk off the stage  
EricMead_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 527.5 530.24 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
EricMead_2009P 1 EricMead_2009P_EricMead 530.24 536.44 <o,f0,male> i will be seeing you several times over the next few days i hope you 're looking forward to that thank you very much
