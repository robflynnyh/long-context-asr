MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 16.11 27.84 <o,f0,male> let 's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool ted ish machine and it 's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 27.84 38.316 <o,f0,male> and i wonder what you 'd choose because i 've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don 't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idol 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 38.316 47.64 <o,f0,male> i don 't know i 'm i 'm convinced that there 's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i 'm not part of that crowd i have to say 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 47.64 57.27 <o,f0,male> i don 't want to go back and it 's not because i 'm adventurous it 's because possibilities on this planet they don 't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 57.27 63.88 <o,f0,male> this is the greatest time there 's ever been on this planet by any measure you wish to choose health wealth 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 63.88 71.56 <o,f0,male> mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there 's never been a time like this my great grandparents 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 71.56 79.704 <o,f0,male> died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents are closing in on eighty so i 've 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 79.704 87.33 <o,f0,male> there 'd better be there 'd better be a nine at the beginning of my death number but it 's not even about people like us because 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 87.33 95.334 <o,f0,male> this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 95.334 98.83 <o,f0,male> think about that it 's an incredible fact and why is it true 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 98.83 107.81 <o,f0,male> smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it 's gone 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 107.81 112.244 <o,f0,male> it 's vanished we vanquished it puff in the rich world 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 112.244 122.41 <o,f0,male> diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 123.68 134.09 <o,f0,male> vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 134.09 134.758 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 134.758 141.356 <o,f0,male> seeing if it works changing it when it doesn 't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that 's the good news 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 141.356 148.12 <o,f0,male> unfortunately that 's all the good news because there 's some other problems and they 've been mentioned many times and one of them is that 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 148.12 152.99 <o,f0,male> despite all our accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 152.99 160.552 <o,f0,male> every day that number 's rising and it 's rising really rapidly and it 's disgraceful and not only that we 've used our imagination 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 160.552 167.86 <o,f0,male> to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforest oil gas they 're going away 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 167.86 173.942 <o,f0,male> and they 're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we 're going away too 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 173.942 186.36 <o,f0,male> so the question is can we do that and i i think we can i think it 's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn 't also destroy it 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 186.36 194.628 <o,f0,male> i really do believe that and no it ain 't wishful thinking but here 's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 194.628 196.102 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 196.102 207.94 <o,f0,male> we 've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we 've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we 're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 207.94 220.25 <o,f0,male> and yet i actually think we 'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we fought about these things more vigorously on on more fronts 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 220.25 229.31 <o,f0,male> than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can 't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 229.31 240.26 <o,f0,male> everyone 's entitled to their opinion they 're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you 're not entitled to you 're not entitled to your own facts sorry you 're not and this took me awhile to figure out 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 240.26 251.84 <o,f0,male> about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 251.84 252.886 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 252.886 259.34 <o,f0,male> i didn 't know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 259.34 260.42 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 260.42 266.94 <o,f0,male> i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 266.94 280.09 <o,f0,male> i wrote a story about that too and i couldn 't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature 's ground 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 280.09 284.25 <o,f0,male> but you know i do what i do i wrote the story i moved on i mean i 'm a journalist 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 284.25 286.79 <o,f0,male> we type we file we go to dinner it 's fine

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 290.904 302.306 <o,f0,male> but these stories bothered me and i couldn 't figure out why and eventually i did and that 's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren 't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 302.306 306.18 <o,f0,male> they were exactly like the people in this room 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 306.18 313.29 <o,f0,male> and it it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let 's be honest we 're at a point in this world 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 313.29 322.408 <o,f0,male> where we don 't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 322.408 323.36 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 323.36 337.59 <o,f0,male> okay there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we 've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there 's no reason we shouldn 't have you can just say a few names and people will understand 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 337.59 341.326 <o,f0,male> chernobyl bhopal the challenger 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 341.326 345.868 <o,f0,male> vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 345.868 349.14 <o,f0,male> i mean you know you can choose your list 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 349.14 355.47 <o,f0,male> there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right so be skeptical 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 355.47 356.468 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 356.468 363.722 <o,f0,male> ask questions demand proof demand evidence don 't take anything for granted but here 's the thing when you get proof 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 363.722 367.66 <o,f0,male> you need to accept the proof and we 're not that good at doing that 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 367.66 378.434 <o,f0,male> and the reason that i can say that is because we 're now in an epidemic of fear like one i 've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 378.434 384.33 <o,f0,male> that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles mumps and rubella vaccine shot

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 385.394 392.4 <o,f0,male> very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it 's a serious issue 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 392.4 393.326 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 393.326 402.43 <o,f0,male> the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 402.43 410.29 <o,f0,male> it doesn 't matter it doesn 't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 410.29 418.35 <o,f0,male> we don 't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i i do understand that i think we all do but you know what 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 418.35 422.99 <o,f0,male> the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here 's a fact 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 422.99 428.86 <o,f0,male> the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 428.86 433.52 <o,f0,male> that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it 's horrible 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 433.52 439.39 <o,f0,male> and what kind what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 439.39 446.12 <o,f0,male> i understand it i do understand it because does anyone have measles here has one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 446.12 455.35 <o,f0,male> doesn 't happen very much doesn 't happen in this country at all but it happened a hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that 's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 inter_segment_gap 455.35 456.534 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 456.534 461.136 <o,f0,male> but since it didn 't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jenny mccarthy 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 461.136 467.86 <o,f0,male> can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 467.86 480.2 <o,f0,male> and they can do it because they don 't link causation and correlation they don 't understand that these things seem the same but they 're almost never the same and it 's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 481.204 489.92 <o,f0,male> this guy was a hero jonas salk he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio puff gone 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 489.92 493.554 <o,f0,male> that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul offit 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 493.554 499.414 <o,f0,male> he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it 's save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 499.414 514.088 <o,f0,male> kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it 's good except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so paul 's a terrorist 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 514.088 524.21 <o,f0,male> when paul speaks in a public hearing he can 't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 524.21 536.98 <o,f0,male> and why because paul made a vaccine i don 't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that 's happening we have measles in this country now 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 536.98 544.81 <o,f0,male> and it 's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it 's just a numbers game and they 're not just going to die of measles what about polio let 's have that 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 544.81 552.976 <o,f0,male> why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought i was a little strident no one 's ever said that before 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 552.976 558.93 <o,f0,male> she wasn 't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 558.93 569.85 <o,f0,male> why because we don 't have polio and you know what we didn 't have polio in this country yesterday today i don 't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he 's flying to lax right now he 's over ohio 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 569.85 584.44 <o,f0,male> and he 's going to land in a couple hours he 's going to rent a car and he 's going to come to long beach and he 's going to attend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesn 't know that he 's infected with a paralytic disease and we don 't either because that 's the way the world works that 's the planet we live on 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 584.44 591.54 <o,f0,male> don 't pretend it isn 't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 730.83 735.45 <o,f0,male> the most mindless epidemic we 're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 801.65 808.39 <o,f0,male> we don 't want companies patenting life we don 't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 808.39 814.53 <o,f0,male> you 're right let 's fix it it 's true we 've got a huge food problem but this isn 't science 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 814.53 822.55 <o,f0,male> this has nothing to do with science it 's law it 's morality it 's patent stuff you know science isn 't a company it 's not a country

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 825.82 836.87 <o,f0,male> it 's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn 't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we 're afraid 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 836.87 843.66 <o,f0,male> is really very deadening and it 's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 857.31 870.53 <o,f0,male> genetically engineered food we don 't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance cassava 's something that half a billion people eat it 's kind of like a potato it 's just a bunch of calories it sucks 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 870.53 876.22 <o,f0,male> it doesn 't have nutrients it doesn 't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 876.22 885.62 <o,f0,male> and then people would be able to eat it and they 'd be able to not go blind they wouldn 't starve and you know what that would be nice it wouldn 't be chez panisse but it would be nice

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 887.716 890.92 <o,f0,male> and all i can say about this is 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 890.92 899.21 <o,f0,male> why are we fighting it why i mean let 's ask ourselves why are we fighting it because we don 't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it 's not about chemicals 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 899.21 906.64 <o,f0,male> it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 906.64 915.886 <o,f0,male> this isn 't about rice krispies this is about keeping people alive and it 's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don 't 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 915.886 926.85 <o,f0,male> if we continue to act the way we 're acting we 're guilty of something that i don 't think we want to be guilty of high tech colonialism there 's no other way to describe what 's going on here it 's selfish 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 926.85 931.29 <o,f0,male> it 's ugly it 's beneath us and we really have to stop it

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 932.256 935.518 <o,f0,male> so after this amazingly fun conversation

MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 937.304 941.54 <o,f0,male> you might want to say so you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 941.54 953.34 <o,f0,male> and absolutely absolutely i do it 's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 953.34 961.48 <o,f0,male> and we 're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 961.48 967.48 <o,f0,male> we 're going to be happy we do i know that we can and as far as i 'm concerned 
MichaelSpecter_2010 1 MichaelSpecter 967.48 972.154 <o,f0,male> that 's something the world needs right now thank you
