TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 16.26 41.56 <o,f0,male> several years ago here at ted peter skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge and the idea 's pretty simple teams of four have to build the tallest free standing structure out of twenty sticks of spaghetti one yard of tape one yard of string and a marshmallow the marshmallow has to be on top and though it seems really simple it 's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 41.56 49.2 <o,f0,male> and so i thought that this was an interesting idea and i incorporated it into a design workshop and it was a huge success and since then i 've 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 49.2 66.66 <o,f0,male> conducted about seventy design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects even the ctos of the fortune fifty and there 's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration and i 'd like to share some of them with you so 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 66.66 87 <o,f0,male> normally most people begin by orienting themselves to the task they talk about it they figure out what it 's going to look like they jockey for power then they spend some time planning organizing they sketch in they lay out spaghetti they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures and then 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 87 95.87 <o,f0,male> finally just as they 're running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and they stand back 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 95.87 97.48 <o,f0,male> and ta da 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 97.48 109.54 <o,f0,male> they admire their work but what really happens most of the time is that the ta da turns into an uh oh because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 109.54 116.82 <o,f0,male> there are a number of people who have a lot more uh oh moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school 
TomWujec_2010U 1 inter_segment_gap 116.82 119.38 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 119.38 131.52 <o,f0,male> they lie they cheat they get distracted and they produce really lame structures and of course there are teams that have a lot more ta da structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten

TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 132.99 133.34 <o,f0,male> and 
TomWujec_2010U 1 inter_segment_gap 133.34 134.81 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 134.81 144.91 <o,f0,male> it 's pretty amazing as peter tells us not only do do they produce the tallest structures but they 're the most interesting structures of them all so the question you want to ask is how come 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 144.91 152.69 <o,f0,male> why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of this none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of spaghetti inc 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 152.69 162.19 <o,f0,male> right they don 't time spend time jockeying for power but there 's another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 162.19 169.49 <o,f0,male> right and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens it 's a crisis 
TomWujec_2010U 1 inter_segment_gap 169.49 171.316 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 171.316 179.95 <o,f0,male> sound familiar right ok what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes successive prototypes 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 179.95 188.63 <o,f0,male> always keeping the marshmallow on top so they have multiple times to to fix ill built prototypes along the way so designers recognize this type of collaboration 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 188.63 196.12 <o,f0,male> as the essence of the iterative process and with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn 't work 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 196.12 202 <o,f0,male> so the capacity to play in prototype is is really essential but let 's look at how different teams perform 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 202 213.85 <o,f0,male> so the average for most people is around twenty inches business schools students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that kindergarteners better than most adults who does the very best 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 213.85 217.67 <o,f0,male> architects and engineers thankfully and 
TomWujec_2010U 1 inter_segment_gap 217.67 222.35 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 222.35 234.55 <o,f0,male> thirty nine inches is the tallest structure i i 've seen and why is it because they understand triangles and self re enforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building self reinforce stable structures 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 234.55 243.81 <o,f0,male> so ceos a little bit better than average but here 's where it gets interesting if you put in an executive admin on the team they get significantly better 
TomWujec_2010U 1 inter_segment_gap 243.81 245.54 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 245.54 246.88 <o,f0,male> terrible you know 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 246.88 260.94 <o,f0,male> you look around you go oh that team 's going to win you can just tell beforehand and why is that because they have specials skills of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and pays a close attention to to work 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 260.94 270.44 <o,f0,male> will significantly improve the team 's performance specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination leads to to strong success 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 270.44 277.76 <o,f0,male> if you have ten teams that typically perform you 'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures and i i tried something interesting i thought let 's 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 277.76 286.93 <o,f0,male> up the ante once so i offered a ten thousand dollar prize of software to the winning team so what do you think happened to these design students what was the result 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 286.93 290.55 <o,f0,male> here 's what happened
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 290.55 311.42 <o,f0,male> not one team had a standing structure not one had a a if anyone had built say a one inch structure they could have taken home the prize so isn 't it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact we did the exercise again with the same students what do you think happened then so now they understand the value of prototyping 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 311.42 325.19 <o,f0,male> so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time so there 's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 325.19 338.57 <o,f0,male> so you might ask why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge and the reason is i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 338.57 345.12 <o,f0,male> and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions because frankly 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 345.12 369.27 <o,f0,male> every project has its own marshmallow doesn 't it the challenge provides a shared experience a common language a common stance to build the right prototype and so this is the value of the experience of this so simple exercise and those of you who are interested may want to go to marshmallowchallenge dot com it 's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows there 's step by step instructions on this there are 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 369.27 375.43 <o,f0,male> crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system there 's world records on this as well 
TomWujec_2010U 1 TomWujec 375.43 402.17 <o,f0,male> and the fundamental lesson i believe is that design truly is a contact sport it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task and that we apply the very best of our thinking our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an uh oh moment to a ta da moment and that can make a big difference thank you very much
