AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 17.82 28.81 <o,f0,female> i 'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i 'm writing anything but   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 28.81 40.266 <o,f0,female> i 'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i 'd find let me read you the entry

AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 95.05 104.05 <o,f0,female> and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock

AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 104.3 109.73 <o,f0,female> uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed  
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 109.73 121.23 <o,f0,female> you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i 'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties  
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 121.23 135.45 <o,f0,female> when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn 't using a thesaurus back then  
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 135.45 149.51 <o,f0,female> i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today  
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 149.51 158.66 <o,f0,female> i 'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately  
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 158.66 168.44 <o,f0,female> went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here 's the updated version of this entry  
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 168.44 180.666 <o,f0,female> unfortunately it 's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome

AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 182.278 184.84 <o,f0,female> so it 's not just about the words 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 184.84 196.18 <o,f0,female> it 's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it 's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking  
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 196.18 206.58 <o,f0,female> and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 206.58 214.08 <o,f0,female> verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence

AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 215.588 225.37 <o,f0,female> so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who 's empowered

AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 225.962 232.19 <o,f0,female> by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 232.19 242.6 <o,f0,female> we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn 't we want to open doors for them instead   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 242.6 253.18 <o,f0,female> one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 253.18 261.72 <o,f0,female> hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 261.72 269.226 <o,f0,female> always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 269.226 278.63 <o,f0,female> i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 278.63 289.48 <o,f0,female> i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 289.48 296.89 <o,f0,female> to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 296.89 304.81 <o,f0,female> you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 304.81 312.78 <o,f0,female> and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 312.78 320.2 <o,f0,female> these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 320.2 329.56 <o,f0,female> i think you 're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i 'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 329.56 338.02 <o,f0,female> on doctor p 's part to get me to do the exercises i didn 't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 338.02 349.47 <o,f0,female> but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 349.47 356.864 <o,f0,female> and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 356.864 367.83 <o,f0,female> as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 367.83 374.854 <o,f0,female> this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 374.854 385.51 <o,f0,female> but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn 't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 385.51 391.01 <o,f0,female> the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 391.01 392.278 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 392.278 402.35 <o,f0,female> our language hasn 't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 402.35 419.4 <o,f0,female> my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 419.4 431.92 <o,f0,female> not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 431.92 433.237 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 433.237 446.75 <o,f0,female> so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 446.75 447.76 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 447.76 458.08 <o,f0,female> and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it 's an interesting thing because people 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 458.08 462.272 <o,f0,female> have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 462.272 474.43 <o,f0,female> and i 'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people 's questions about it and i think i 'm starting to figure out why 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 474.43 483.16 <o,f0,female> implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 483.16 491.71 <o,f0,female> is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 491.71 502.676 <o,f0,female> as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 502.676 515.12 <o,f0,female> but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 515.12 524.35 <o,f0,female> adversity isn 't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it 's part of our life   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 524.35 533.17 <o,f0,female> and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there 's very little but it 's always with me   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 533.17 541.35 <o,f0,female> and certainly i 'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person 's struggle there is   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 541.35 552.15 <o,f0,female> adversity and challenge in life and it 's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn 't whether or not you 're going to meet adversity but how you 're going to meet it   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 552.15 562.79 <o,f0,female> so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 562.79 573.75 <o,f0,female> and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they 're not equipped to adapt   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 573.75 587.55 <o,f0,female> there 's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i 'm disabled   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 587.55 599.168 <o,f0,female> and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i 've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 599.168 606.64 <o,f0,female> in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 606.64 616.24 <o,f0,female> or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don 't put the first brick in a wall that will actually   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 616.24 625.91 <o,f0,female> disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 625.91 635.63 <o,f0,female> serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 635.63 644.4 <o,f0,female> by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 644.4 659.37 <o,f0,female> we are effectively grading someone 's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 659.37 669.29 <o,f0,female> and most importantly there 's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 669.29 681.08 <o,f0,female> so it 's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 681.08 693.7 <o,f0,female> wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 693.7 695.864 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 695.864 704.018 <o,f0,female> embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 inter_segment_gap 704.018 705.69 <o,,unknown> ignore_time_segment_in_scoring
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 705.69 716.87 <o,f0,female> and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we 're less burdened by the presence of it 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 716.87 729.03 <o,f0,female> this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 729.03 741.1 <o,f0,female> to paraphrase it 's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 741.1 753.91 <o,f0,female> conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin 's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 753.91 765.87 <o,f0,female> is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 765.87 779.774 <o,f0,female> human skill and perhaps you know until we 're tested we don 't know what we 're made of maybe that 's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 779.774 790.16 <o,f0,female> so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 790.16 798.72 <o,f0,female> maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven 't adapted ourselves to yet   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 798.72 804.38 <o,f0,female> i think the greatest adversity that we 've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 804.38 811.66 <o,f0,female> now who 's normal there 's no normal there 's common there 's typical 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 811.66 821.97 <o,f0,female> there 's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don 't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 821.97 835.09 <o,f0,female> achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 835.09 849.25 <o,f0,female> their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 849.25 859.68 <o,f0,female> there 's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 859.68 868.86 <o,f0,female> and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 868.86 876.84 <o,f0,female> they didn 't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 876.84 883.06 <o,f0,female> few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 883.06 892.05 <o,f0,female> and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn 't aimee mullins   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 892.05 899.05 <o,f0,female> and i turn around and it 's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i 'm sorry sir  i don 't 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 899.05 907.2 <o,f0,female> have we met i i don 't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn 't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother 's womb 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 907.2 913.63 <o,f0,female> oh that guy and but of course actually   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 913.63 922.62 <o,f0,female> it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother 's stories of that day because of course   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 922.62 935.65 <o,f0,female> typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother 's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 935.65 944.78 <o,f0,female> and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 944.78 953.39 <o,f0,female> had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 953.39 961.216 <o,f0,female> and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you 've been making liar out of me ever since

AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 969.39 975.77 <o,f0,female> the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 975.77 985.93 <o,f0,female> whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 985.93 994.17 <o,f0,female> and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 994.17 1002.99 <o,f0,female> medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1002.99 1011.28 <o,f0,female> no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone 's life 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1011.28 1022.04 <o,f0,female> and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1022.04 1031.66 <o,f0,female> and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1031.66 1041.97 <o,f0,female> see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there 's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1041.97 1055.78 <o,f0,female> and there 's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you 'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn 't have hesitated for a second 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1055.78 1065.39 <o,f0,female> i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i 'm not so sure 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1065.39 1075.71 <o,f0,female> and it 's because of the experiences i 've had with them not in spite of the experiences i 've had with them   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1075.71 1090.7 <o,f0,female> and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i 've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1090.7 1101.7 <o,f0,female> see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you 're off if you can hand somebody the key   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1101.7 1112.4 <o,f0,female> to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense   
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1112.4 1121.74 <o,f0,female> you 're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1121.74 1133.61 <o,f0,female> comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out

AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1135.42 1145.66 <o,f0,female> there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it 's called the streaming trials we call it tracking 
AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1145.66 1151.07 <o,f0,female> here in the states it 's separating students from a b c d and so on

AimeeMullins_2009P 1 AimeeMullins 1165.65 1174.92 <o,f0,female> they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
